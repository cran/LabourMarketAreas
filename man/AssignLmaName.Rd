\description{
Given the names of the original communities (elementary area or municipality) as input, this function assigns the name to each labour market area given its code. The assigned LMA name corresponds to the name of the community having the highest number of jobs (incoming commuters) among all the communities in the corresponding LMA. If more than one community shares the maximum number of jobs, the first one is taken. In order to differ the community name by the LMA with the same name, the community is expressed as  first letter in uppercase and the remaining letters in lowercase, whereas the LMA name is all in uppercase.
